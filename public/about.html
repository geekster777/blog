<p>Hi, I'm Nick Hilton.</p>

<p>I am a Computer Science student attending Rochester Institute of Technology. It will be my home until 2016, and I live here on <a href="http://csh.rit.edu" target="new">Computer Science House</a>. I consider Computer Science House to be my family and my real university. I learn much more by pursuing personal projects there than I ever could in the classroom.</p>
 
<p>Now let's talk about the website itself. The front end is built utilizing CSS3, and AngularJS. The backend is a custom NodeJS server. It is currently being run on a raspberry pi in my basement. I decided to write everything myself as a fun project to keep me occupied while I was on co-op for the Spring, and for now it does everything I need. Also, the source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/geekster777/blog" target="new">github</a> if you care to take a look.</p>

<p>Anyways, I'm Nick. I'm a hardworking student. I tend to excel in team based projects, and especially those with little supervision. It has to do with my ability to set goals with strict deadlines whenever working on a project, and keeping those around me on a similar timeline.</p>

<p>If you're a recruiter and read this far, I'll relieve you with some of the nitty gritty:</p>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So if you're still reading, I hope you have been at least slightly amused. I look forward to hearing from you. Partly because I like the idea of having a job this summer, but mostly because recruiters are really nice people. I know they're paid to represent their company in the most friendly way, but I just find myself so cheered up after an interview with a recruiter. Now engineers on the other hand, they are just downright scary in interviews. Oh well, no helping that. I just hope that in a matter of years, I will be in their shoes, and get the satisfaction of striking a similar fear into the eyes of up and coming software engineers.</p>

<p>Well, I guess that's everything. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions, comments, concerns, or website criticism.</p>
