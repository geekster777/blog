<p>Hi, I'm Nick Hilton.</p>

<p>If you're reading this, then you're probably a recruiter and wondering why I put this incomplete mess of a website on my resume in the first place. But despite the fact that it is incomplete, I think it very nicely portrays my skills as a web developer. That is, unless you are viewing this in Internet Explorer. Then I truly hope that you are using Internet Explorer 10+, or my header will look like a royal mess. But more on this website, it is build utilizing CSS3, and AngularJS. It is currently being run on a raspberry pi in my basement. Also, the source code is available <a href="https://github.com/geekster777/blog">here</a> if you care to take a look.</p>

<p>Anyways, I'm Nick. I'm a hardworking student attending Rochester Institute of Technology. I tend to excel in team based projects, and especially those with little supervision. It has to do with my ability to set goals with strict deadlines whenever working on a project, and keeping those around me on a similar timeline. </p>

<p>If you've read this far, or are just skimming, I'll relieve you with some of the nitty gritty:</p>

</ul>

<p>So if you're still reading, I hope you have been at least slightly amused. I look forward to hearing from you. Partly because I like the idea of having a job this summer, but mostly because recruiters are really nice people. I know they're paid to represent their company in the most friendly way, but I just find myself so cheered up after an interview with a recruiter. No matter how nervous I start off, I feel confident by the end. Now engineers on the other hand, they are just downright scary in interviews. Oh well, no helping that. I just hope that in a matter of years, I will be in their shoes, and get the satisfaction of striking a similar fear into the eyes of up and coming software engineers.</p>

<p>Well, I guess that's everything. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions, comments, concerns, or website criticism.</p>
